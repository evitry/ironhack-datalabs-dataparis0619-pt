    "Now we want to enhance the `get_bow_from_docs` function so that it will work with HTML webpages. In HTML, there are a lot of messy codes such as HTML tags, Javascripts, [unicodes](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_misc_symbols.asp) that will mess up your bag of words. We need to clean up those junk before generating BoW.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, what you will do is to define several new functions each of which is specialized to clean up the HTML codes in one aspect. For instance, you can have a `strip_html_tags` function to remove all HTML tags, a `remove_punctuation` function to remove all punctuation, a `to_lower_case` function to convert string to lowercase, and a `remove_unicode` function to remove all unicodes.\n",

      "i was also very impressed with the professor alan he is an extremely knowledgeable person with a natural aptitude for teaching always patient courteous and welcoming of questions feedback and taking time to ask us if we all understood or were running into any problems what really impressed me most about alan is how he would take a little bit of time at the start of each class to go beyond the curriculum and to challenge us with computer science coding challenges to prepare us to think like computer scientists and get us ready for the types of questions we would likely see in a coding interview and explain the different ways to approach the problems and how to think about them in terms of time complexity or memory management it was well beyond what i expected from a web development course and i found these lessons particularly rewarding alan has a knack for breaking down complex and abstract concepts into digestible bits and getting the class comfortable enough to try and collectively attempt a solution protip always volunteer to try and solve the problems he presents i noticed the students brave enough to attempt these problems retained information better and walked away with a more solid understanding if he gives you the marker get up there and give it your best effort go home and research the concepts further just do it  get a whiteboard for your house and write important concepts objectives goals and problem examples from class this will force your brain to reconcile this new information on a daily basis you will almost certainly see these types of coding challenges in job interviews and theyre abstract and frustrating if you are not prepared\n",
